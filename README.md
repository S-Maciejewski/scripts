# scripts
### Motivation
This repository contains various scripts in Python, PowerShell etc. that might be useful to somebody. 
I will try to regularly upload some scripts that I wrote or used over the years to perform various tasks. 
From automating simple and mundane procedures to hacking a simpler way of executing tasks that are difficult to perform using standard OS tools, I hope you will find something useful here.

## How to use
Each script has it's own directory in which both source files and a short readme can be found. The idea is to empower **every** user, regardless of their experience, use the scripts with ease. This is why in each readme there are listed requirements and dependencies along with commands to install those dependencies (i.e. for a Python script that requires some packages, there are `pip install` commands listed in readme).

Each readme contains precise instructions on how to run the script and a brief description of a problem the script was designed to solve.

### Important notice
Most of the scripts require having given interpreter or runtime environment installed on the machine and are run from command line. 

**In most cases, knowing how to open command line is enough to use the scripts**
