# Zip separate files automatically
This script compresses ("zips") all files with given extension (.csv by default) in it's directory **separately**.

Useful for i.e. building multiple .zip archives for daily data output (the script preserves original file name).

## Use
```
./zip_separately.ps1
```

## Requirements
PowerShell 5.x+ (comes as default with Windows 10)
