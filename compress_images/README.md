# Secure image compressor
This script compresses all images (by default .jpgs) in it's directory (by default, can be changed) - sacrifices a bit of quality but can save a lot of space.

Useful for i.e. **scanned documents with personal information**, that you do not want to upload to unknown compression websites - this way the image is safely compressed on your machine.

## Use
```
python ./main.py
```

## Requirements
python 3.x 
#### Dependencies
This script requires Pillow package, can be installed with 
```
pip instal Pillow
```
